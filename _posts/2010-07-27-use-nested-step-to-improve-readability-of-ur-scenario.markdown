Before:

    Scenario: Accessing create post page
      Given flyerhzm exists
      And a post exists with title: "first best practice"
      And I go to login page
      And I fill in "Username" with "flyerhzm"
      And I fill in "Password" with "flyerhzm"
      And I press "Login"
      When I follow "Submit"
      Then I should see "Share a Rails Best Practice" page

After:

    Scenario: Accessing create post page
      Given I am already signed in as "flyerhzm"
      When I follow "Submit"
      Then I should see "Share a Rails Best Practice" page

And the corresponding step definition:

    # features/step_definitions/custom_web_steps.rb
    Given %r{^I am already signed in as "([^"]*)"$} do |someone|
      user = Factory.build(someone)
      Given "#{someone} exists" rescue nil
      And %|I go to login page|
      And %|I fill in "Username" with "#{user.login}"|
      And %|I fill in "Password" with "#{user.password}"|
      And %|I press "Login"|
    end
