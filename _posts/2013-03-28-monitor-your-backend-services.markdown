title: monitor your backend services
author: Richard Huang
description: We always have multiple processes for rails websites, if any of them crashed, your website failed, so it would be better to monitor all of the processes and automatically restart crashed processes.

I have maintained [rails-bestpractices.com](rails-bestpractices.com) website for several years, not only code, but also server administration. The website is running on [linode](http://www.linode.com/?r=aa5686444f1835b95ee23ee5321824f6bc75c550) with multiple processes:

 1. nginx - http reverse proxy server
 2. puma - ruby app server
 3. mysql - database server
 4. memcached - cache server
 5. sphinx - full text search server
 6. delayed_job - background job process

As you can see, it has multiple dependencies, if one of these processes stopped, the website is down or some features disabled. It's very common that your processes are terminated, like the host is power outage or cpu / memory usage is too high. So you need a tool that can monitor your processes and restart them automatically after crashed.

Generally you have 2 choices: [god](http://godrb.com/) and [monit](http://mmonit.com/), both of them work well. God is a ruby gem, monit is a more generic monitoring tool, they can monitor servers, processes, send notifications if resource usage is higher than you expected, they can restart your processes if crashed, they also provide terminal and web ui to check processes status.

Here is the god status

    $ god status
    conferences-box-server:
      conferences-box-server.1: up
      conferences-box-server.2: up

Monit status looks more powerful

    $ sudo monit status
    The Monit daemon 5.0.3 uptime: 2d 18h 15m

After using them, I never worried if rails-bestpractices.com is down, even after a server restart. :-)
