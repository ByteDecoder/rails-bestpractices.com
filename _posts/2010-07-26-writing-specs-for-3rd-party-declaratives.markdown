title: Writing specs for 3rd party declaratives
author: Ng Tze Yang
description: Using declaratives (eg. acts_as_authentic) provided by external libs is unavoidable in building a rails application. But testing 3rd party libs is surely not part of our work, yet how do we rest assured that these declaratives are called ??

Rule of thumb, never ever test 3rd party (external) libs, unless u suspect the lib is buggy, and want to prove to the lib author(s). Yet, we need to have a way to ensure the declaratives are called. Here's what i do to stike a balance:

    # app/models/user.rb
    model User < ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_authentic
    end

    # spec/models/user_spec.rb
    describe User do
      include RailsBestPractices::Macros
      should_act_as_authentic
    end

Building upon wat we already have in [write ur own spec macros][1]:

    # spec/macros.rb
    module RailsBestPractices::Macros::ClassMethods

        def should_act_as_authentic
           should_include_module 'should be acting as authentic', /Authlogic::ActsAsAuthentic::/
        end

        private

          def should_include_module(description, module_name_or_regexp)

             # Calling of 3rd party declarative usually have the side effect of including extra module(s)
             # from the lib, we want to ignore the ones included by a basic model (with no declaratives called),
             # and grab only those extra modules, specific for the context class
             basic_included_modules = Class.new(ActiveRecord::Base).included_modules
             klass_included_modules = context_klass.included_modules
             extra_modules = (klass_included_modules - basic_included_modules).map(&:to_s)

             it(description) do
               case module_name_or_regexp
               when Regexp
                 extra_modules.any?{|mod| mod =~ module_name_or_regexp }.should be_true
               else
                 extra_modules.should include(module_name_or_regexp.to_s)
               end
             end
          end

    end
